		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poem for vows <span>Hello beautiful talented dark semi-optimists of June,</span> <span>from far off <em>I send my hopes Brooklyn is sunny, and the ghost of Whitman who <em>loved everyone <em>is there to see you say what can never be said, <em>something <em>like partly I<em> promise my whole life to try to figure out what it means to stand facing you under a tree, and partly no matter how angry<em> I get I will always remember<em> we met before we<em> were born, it was in a <em>village, someone had just cast a spell, it was in the park, 
		<ul>
			<li>snow everywhere,</li>
			 <li>we were slipping and laughing,</li>
			 <li> at last we knew the green secret, we were sea turtles <strong>swimming a <strong>long time together without needing to breathe, we were two hungry owls silently hunting night, our terrible claws, </li>
			 <li>I do not want to sound like I know, I am just one who worries all <strong>night about <strong>people in a <strong>lab watching <em>a storm in a glass terrarium perform lethal ubiquity, <strong>tiny black <strong>clouds make the final ideogram <strong>above miniature lands <strong>exactly resembling ours, </li>
			 <li>what is happening happens again, they cannot stop it, they take off <strong>their white coats, go outside, look up and wonder, only we who promise everything despite everything can tell them the solution, only we know.</li>
		</ul>
