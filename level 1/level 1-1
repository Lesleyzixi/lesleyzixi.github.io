		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poem for vows <br><br>Hello beautiful talented dark semi-optimists of June,<br>from far off I send my hopes Brooklyn is sunny, <br>and the ghost of Whitman who loved everyone is there to see you say what can never be said, <br>something like partly I promise my whole life to try to figure out what it means to stand facing you under a tree, <br>and partly no matter how angry I get I will always remember we met before we were born,<br>it was in a village, <br>someone had just cast a spell, it was in the park, snow everywhere,<br> we were slipping and laughing, <br>at last we knew the green secret, <br>we were sea turtles swimming a long time together without needing to breathe, <br>we were two hungry owls silently hunting night, <br>our terrible claws, <br>I do not want to sound like I know, <br>I am just one who worries all night about people in a lab watching a storm in a glass terrarium perform lethal ubiquity, <br>tiny black clouds make the final ideogram above miniature lands exactly resembling ours, <br>what is happening happens again, <br>they cannot stop it, <br>they take off their white coats, <br>go outside, <br>look up and wonder, <br>only we who promise everything despite everything can tell them the solution, <br>only we know.
